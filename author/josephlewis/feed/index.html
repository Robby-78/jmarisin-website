<p>Genealogists use oral interviews, historical records, genetic analysis, and other records to obtain information about a family and to demonstrate kinship and pedigrees of its members. The results are often displayed in charts or written as narratives. The field of family history is broader than genealogy, and covers not just lineage but also family and community history and biography.</p>



<p>The record of genealogical work may be presented as a &#8220;genealogy,&#8221; a &#8220;family history,&#8221; or a &#8220;family tree.&#8221; In the narrow sense, a &#8220;genealogy&#8221; or a &#8220;family tree&#8221; traces the descendants of one person, whereas a &#8220;family history&#8221; traces the ancestors of one person, but the terms are often used interchangeably. A family history may include additional biographical information, family traditions, and the like.</p>

<p>Private individuals research genealogy out of curiosity about their heritage. This curiosity can be particularly strong among those whose family histories were lost or unknown due to, for example, adoption or separation from family through divorce, death, or other situations. In addition to simply wanting to know more about who they are and where they came from, individuals may research their genealogy to learn about any hereditary diseases in their family history.</p>



<p>There is a growing interest in family history in the media as a result of advertising and television shows sponsored by large genealogy companies. This, coupled with easier access to online records and the affordability of DNA tests, has both inspired curiosity and allowed those who are curious to easily start investigating their ancestry.</p>
