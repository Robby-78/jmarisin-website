His middle name was in honour of his father&#8217;s aunt, Ann Speed, who had raised his father from the age of eight. His brother Oswald was born in 1887. Spedan was educated at Westminster School.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_01.jpg\" alt=\"History\" class=\"wp-image-294\" width=\"400\" height=\"527\" srcset=\"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_01.jpg 800w, https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_01-455x600.jpg 455w, https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_01-768x1012.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption>Father and uncle of John Lewis<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Career<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spedan Lewis joined his father&#8217;s John Lewis department store on Oxford Street, London, aged 19. On his 21st birthday he was given a <strong>quarter share<\/strong> in the business, and in 1914 assumed control of his father&#8217;s second shop, Peter Jones in Sloane Square, London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was around this time that he first realised that the salaries of himself, his brother and his father were the same amount of money as the combined salaries of everyone employed by the John Lewis stores. In 1909, a serious horse-riding accident meant that he could not work for nearly two years. It was during this time that he seems to have first evolved the desire to share profits with his employees, and which grew over time in scope and detail to become the underpinnings of <em>the John Lewis Trust<\/em> and <em>John Lewis Partnership<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming control of the Oxford Street store with his father&#8217;s death in 1928, Lewis officially formed <em>the John Lewis Partnership<\/em>, and began the distribution of profits among its employees (known as &#8220;partners&#8221;) in 1929. The essence of the partnership was that workers could \u201c<strong>get the whole profit and the sharing is entirely among themselves<\/strong>.\u201d Partnership benefit, as it was called, was distributed in the form of shares, which could be realised for cash. He completed the move towards employee-ownership in 1950, with the transfer of control to the employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_02.jpg\" alt=\"History\" class=\"wp-image-295\" width=\"400\" height=\"507\" srcset=\"https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_02.jpg 800w, https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_02-473x600.jpg 473w, https:\/\/preview.lsvr.sk\/lineago\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/8\/2022\/01\/history_02-768x973.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><figcaption>John Lewis with his siblings and their partners<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Spedan Lewis resigned as chairman in 1955, and was known within the company from that point on as &#8220;The Founder&#8221;.

They had three children, John Hunter (1924-1932), Jill (1927-1968) and Edward Grosvener (1929-2008). Sarah Lewis became deputy chairman of the company, and remained so until her death in 1953.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Legacy of John Lewis<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The happiest moments of my life have been the few which I have passed at home in the bosom of my family.<\/p><cite>Thomas Jefferson<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his life Lewis was a keen and active natural historian.
